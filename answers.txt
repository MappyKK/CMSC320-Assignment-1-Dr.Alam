Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: Because it is free to use! It is open source, it allows 
for collaboration, version control, as well as branching and merging.
In our case it will be very useful to use to collaborate with group members 
when working on our data science project while simultaneously allowing 
us to maintain a complete history of all of the changes that we have 
made to our project.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: One field that data science can be applied to is the health
field. More specifically it help analyse and forecast disease
outbreaks using predictive models in order to help health care workers
prepare. For example, if it was not for data science we would not 
know the extent of the covid-19 outbreak and the effects or impacts
that it has left on the world.
