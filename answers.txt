Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: Because it is free to use! It is open source, it allows 
for collaboration, version control, as well as branching and merging.
In our case it will be very useful to use to collaborate with group members 
when working on our data science project while simultaneously allowing 
us to maintain a complete history of all of the changes that we have 
made to our project.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: One field that data science can be applied to is the health
field. More specifically it help analyse and forecast disease
outbreaks using predictive models in order to help health care workers
prepare. For example, if it was not for data science we would not 
know the extent of the covid-19 outbreak and the effects or impacts
that it has left on the world.


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging is basically combining the changes made in two
branches into one while rebashing is when you take the changes from
one branch and reapply them on top of another branch. Each one has
their their own advantages, for example, merging allows the user to
preserve the history of changes allowing you to easily do version
control through each commit that is being logged with each branch
that was merged still existing seperately while rebasing allows 
you have cleaner history due to less merge commits making it easier 
to understand with you having to avoid fixing merge conflicts. 

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to improve my pandas, SQL, data cleaning,
visualization, machine learning, and deep learning skills.
