Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: One field that data science can be applied to is the health
field. More specifically it help analyse and forecast disease
outbreaks using predictive models in order to help health care workers
prepare. For example, if it was not for data science we would not know the extent of the covid-19 outbreak and the effects that it has left on the world.
